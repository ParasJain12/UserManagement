# UserManagement
## Task: Need to create Console base app.
Where admin can perform crud operation (For example admin can create user, delete user, Fetch single user, fetch all user, Update user)
### User fields: name, email, mobile number
1. When creating user, please be careful if one user is already existing with same email then return message user already exist.
2. User can have multiple numbers.
3. When performing search operation for any user return user if present and if not present then throw UserNotFoundException
4. check for email and number validation

### UserManagement.java: is a java file that implements above application using user class and does not add dofferent types of edge cases.
### UserMgmt.java: is a java file that also implements above application directly without creating any custom class and also add different types of edge cases.
